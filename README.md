# Stock Picker

# Build Instructions.

You can do this with or without a venv but I am gonna try include usage of a venv in the instructions.

* Make sure you have python 3.6 installed.
* `pip3 install virtualenv`
* Extract the project zip I sent you and open up a terminal to the project folder location.
*  `virtualenv stock-venv` This will create a virtual env.
*  `source stock-venv/bin/activate`
*  `pip install -r requirements.txt`

To start stock picker run `python stock_picker.py data.csv`.
To run tests one can use `python tests.py`.
